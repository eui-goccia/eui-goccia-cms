Knowing its history can be a source of inspiration for those who refuse to sell off the piece of the world in which they were born or moved, arriving from another region or another continent. La Goccia is a model for those who refuse to surrender to what has happened in Milan in recent years, with rising inequality and institutions powerless in the face of real estate market imbalances that have transformed the city into a playground for wealthy and careless city users. La Goccia teaches that resistance is possible. This is its story.",

It\'s a vast green area northwest of Milan, dotted with lime trees, poplars, black locust trees, paulownias, plane trees, hackberry trees, cherry trees, walnut trees, plum trees, and more. A deep silence reigns, occasionally interrupted by the sound of a Trenord train passing by on its way to Saronno, Erba, or Cadorna station. It\'s approximately 20 hectares of vegetation, quiet, and contemplation. The term "post-industrial forest" aptly describes La Goccia, although it can become one of those pompous labels useful for fueling harmful word of mouth.',

It borders the Bovisa, Quarto Oggiaro, and Villapizzone neighborhoods, as well as the Polytechnic University buildings, and is bordered by a ring of railway tracks.

It's the now inert structure of the old gasometer, which has occupied the Goccia space since the early 1900s. At the time of writing, the other old gasometer is absent, dismantled and awaiting reassembly, like a Meccano toy.",

Inside, scattered ruins dotted with greenery and old buildings with broken windows are surrounded by partially overgrown railroad ties, curbs, and concrete tanks. Beneath vast ceilings ravaged by time, the remains of imposing machinery, tanks, and pipes survive. For nearly a century, the La Goccia area was an industrial site. It was first home to the Union de Gas and then to the Officine del Gas, the company that met the city\'s gas needs through the distillation of coal (first for street lighting, then for domestic and industrial use). After several changes of management, the last operations ceased in 1994. Since then, access to the site has been blocked by a surrounding wall topped with barbed wire. A new layer of earth has formed on the asphalt that covered much of the surface, grass has sprouted, and particularly stubborn plants, such as the hackberry (Celtis australis, also known as the "stonebreaker"), have taken root.',

Ten Years of Struggle for the La Goccia Forest in Bovisa, written by two activists, Francesca Grazzini and Luciana Bordin, with a preface by Lucia Tozzi. It was the summer of 2012. The City of Milan presented the Monti government with a project for the construction of a new neighborhood in the La Goccia area. The real estate company behind the project is Euromilano, and the master plan is being handled by Rem Koolhaas's architectural firm. The new neighborhood will span 730,000 square meters of gross floor area. In place of that vast urban void, once occupied by the Gas Works, hotels, residences, and offices will be built. The committee disagrees. It disputes the definition of an urban void. There is no urban void. On the contrary, there is a fullness, a forest, a rich arboreal womb that conceals in its shadow a heritage of industrial archaeology. Over the course of nearly a century, the Officine del Gas (which would later be absorbed by AEM, the Municipal Electricity Company) have planted hundreds of trees.",

They aren't volatile and careless city users, but organized and aware citizens. The Professor knows his stuff. He's a militant urban planner (Giuseppe Boatti, a well-known figure in the city), trained in the Communist Party, and always on the side of citizens and the common good, always ready and on the ball when it comes to taking part in a debate. He dreams of a Milanese Central Park, a public green corridor connecting the Scalo Farini area with the Goccia area. The soil at La Goccia, however, is contaminated, the Municipality claims, and must be plowed, excavated, and removed, along with all the greenery and trees that cover it. It's inevitable. They might as well start from scratch and build a new neighborhood on top of it. The committee opposes this, pinning green teardrop-shaped felt pins to their chests, challenging the literature on the presence of pollutants, and proposing an alternative remediation method: \"phytoremediation.\" This involves the targeted planting of trees and plants, depending on the pollutant being addressed. It's a very slow remediation method. The battle with the Municipality continues with dossiers, appeals, and public debates. They are demanding that La Goccia be included in the PGT (Territorial Management Plan) as a protected green area.",

In June 2021, the group that would found Terrapreta and bring together partners for a new organization, the La Goccia Observatory, decided to conduct a random tree mapping. Using software (called iTree-Eco), an analysis of the forest and its potential was performed. How much carbon can it store? How much water can it hold? How many trees are there? And what species do they belong to? Terrapreta presented the collected data to the Municipality and initiated discussions with the Departments of Greenery, Participation, and Urban Planning. The final outcome was the signing of a collaboration agreement. CNR Iret, Italia Nostra, Progetto Natura Onlus, and the Natural History Museum became partners of the Observatory. At this point, Terrapreta and the committee's paths diverged. What divided them was, above all, a difference in their approach to the Municipality.",

Along with the other committee members, she has dedicated her efforts, imagination, and energy to supporting the cause. Puppet shows are also organized. But it's not enough. \"For most people, the forest, being beyond a wall, remained a pure abstraction,\" she says. In 2019, together with Gianluca Rapaccini and the other men and women of the committee, Edi worked first on the creation of the trails and then, for two years, on the design of a unique museum, set among the trees and bushes of the Goccia. Edi contacted around thirty artists around the world. He wrote to them and offered to donate objects and sculptures that would be placed here and there along a path. The artists understood the spirit of the project and offered their services free of charge. It wasn't a given. The goal is to somehow humanize the forest, making it a more hospitable, less disturbing place, toning down its more threatening appearances. The sculptures intensify the philosophical experience of the forest, says Edi, and echo the invitation to reflection, introspection, or dialogue with others that walking among the trees naturally evokes. The museum-in-the-forest initiative is a resounding success. Hundreds enter the Drop for the first time. Even during the pandemic, the Drop becomes a relief valve and fills with people who find space to breathe and wander freely.",

Another time we discovered a clearing with a walnut tree in the center. It seemed strange to us, but then, through study, we discovered that the walnut tree's roots release toxins that prevent other plants from growing. One day we returned with a botanist, Gabriele Galasso. Galasso pointed out to us the presence of some orchids—I would call them primitive, ancestral, belonging to an era before industrialization. At La Goccia, I discovered a silence similar to that of churches. I realized I was inside something alive, a great organism.”",

Why have they attributed so much importance to it, to the point of sacrificing part of their own existence? Certainly, civic conscience, environmental awareness, and individual biographies (Boatti\'s membership in the Italian Communist Party) played a role, but perhaps something else mattered, and that is the symbol, the archetype, the vibration that the word "forest" or "woods" evokes in a human being, the image of the forest, the one we carry within us, conveyed in stories, in fairy tales (or in cartoons, which in turn were inspired by some fairy tale). The forest of Little Red Riding Hood and Hansel and Gretel, Dante\'s forest, therefore the forest as mystery, as threshold, as risk. The place where the hero or heroine gets lost. Where a test or a transformation takes place. The presence of poisons in the soil, the infection, adds a magical ingredient, making the Drop a more complex and contemporary variant of the old fairytale forest. The forest, in a certain sense, is the antithesis, the counterpoint, the nemesis of a place like Milan, a practical, concrete, often cynical, swift, and unmysterious city. For many, entering the forest has meant rediscovering their lungs, their feet, suspending time and reconnecting for a few hours with a part of themselves.',

										text: "\"We're actually inside a forest, but formally it's a polluted area undergoing remediation,\" explains Gabriele Galasso, a botanist at Milan's Civic Museum of Natural History. Galasso, along with his colleague Lara Quaglini, accompanies me on a tour of a place still off-limits to the public, but which for many years has been visited, more or less unauthorized, by the curious and groups of Urbex (urban explorers), often drawn to the ruins of the industrial architecture. The silhouettes of the two gasometers have become the very symbol of Bovisa and its industrial past. We enter the Goccia through the northwest entrance, on the opposite side from the construction work, which instead affects the area closest to the gasometers, and where the railway tracks separate Bovisa from the Villapizzone neighborhood. This is where coal loads destined for distillation once entered. Today, however, plants and flowers that thrive in abandoned places grow spontaneously and have found their ideal habitat in this post-industrial landscape: mullein, which grows in cracks in the asphalt and is covered in hairs to protect itself from the sun's rays and dehydration; saxifrage, a protected species, once widespread along Milan's ramparts and now surviving only in railway areas and marginal contexts (such as, obviously, the one we find ourselves in); and South African ragwort, an invasive species that exploits railways and other transport routes to spread, adapting, as Galasso explains, \"to situations of great stress and environmental degradation.\"",

Among the many plants that appreciate this post-industrial landscape and contribute to its rebirth, others emerge that, instead, represent the historical memory of the Milan area and have populated it since before the city itself, around the 5th century BC. This is the case of the wild orchid (Cephalanthera longifolia): a native plant whose spread in these parts predates both the industrial and agricultural eras.",

But studies confirming these effects are often lacking. For this reason, we conducted and published research to evaluate the ecological impact of ragwort on soil flora and microorganisms, but we found no significant effects. Of course, it can become locally abundant, but it tends to appear where vegetation is sparse: once the environment closes in, it can no longer compete.

As mentioned, this process is also occurring through natural processes, and significant positive signs are already being identified. One such process is the presence of Cladonia rei in the heart of the Goccia forest: a lichen species that cannot grow in contaminated soil, and its presence indicates that at least a portion of the soil has been naturally remediated and requires no further intervention. The experts who manage the Goccia are studying how the plants themselves, with the help of fungi and bacteria, can contribute to the remediation of the area by absorbing and metabolizing hydrocarbons and heavy metals. Understanding the dynamics of this process, known as bioremediation, will help decide if, where, how, and how much to intervene with natural solutions.',

In nature, when trees fall, clearings are created and the natural cycle restarts, but in limited areas this phenomenon is relatively blocked. If we want to maintain these environments and preserve biodiversity, we need to remove patches of moss and grass from time to time to restart the cycle; otherwise, within 10 or 20 years, it will all become forest, reducing the number of species. Biodiversity, on the other hand, is the sum of environments and the species that populate them; if it becomes a single environment, biodiversity will necessarily be lower."',
